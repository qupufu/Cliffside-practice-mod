~~there's an injectable practice mod that can be found in the celeste classic discord so this mod is pretty pointless. The injectable version works way better than what I made so I'd recomend you download that instead.~~ 

Well the injectable practice mod doesn't work on cliffside for some reason so I guess that this isn't dead.

# Cliffside-practice-mod
A simple practice mod for Rubyred's Cliffside. I don't even know lua so the code is probably pretty messy
